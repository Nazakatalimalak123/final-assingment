//10. Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one comment to each. If you
//don’t have anything specific to write because your programs are too simple at this point, just add your name and
//the current date at the top of each program file. Then write one sentence describing what the program does.
//my name is nazakat
//dated 22/02/2024
console.log("hello world simple programm");
// //task 10 file 2
// //my name is nazakat
// //dated 22/02/2024
//this program wil multiply
 console.log(5*2);

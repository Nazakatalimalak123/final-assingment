//42. Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() that
//modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians()
//to see that the list has actually been modified.
function make_great(magicians) {
    for (var i = 0; i < magicians.length; i++) {
        magicians[i] = magicians[i] + 'the great';
    }
}
var magicians2 = ["ali", "atif", "ahmed"];
make_great(magicians2);
show_magicians(magicians2);
